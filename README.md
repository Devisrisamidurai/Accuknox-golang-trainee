This repository contains an eBPF program (drop_tcp.c) designed to drop TCP packets on a user-configurable port. It utilizes the Linux kernel's eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) technology for efficient packet processing.

Requirements:

Linux kernel version 4.1 or higher (for eBPF support)
bcc tools (https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) installed
C compiler (e.g., GCC)
Installation:

Clone this repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ebpf-tcp-drop.git
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Compile the eBPF program:

Bash
cd ebpf-tcp-drop
gcc -o drop_tcp drop_tcp.c -I/usr/include/bcc -lbcc -lpthread
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Replace /usr/include/bcc with the actual path to your bcc headers if it's not in the default location.
Usage:

Set the desired port to drop (replace 4040 with your target port):

Python
# userspace_config.py
from ctypes import *

# Load the eBPF program
bpf_obj = CDLL("./drop_tcp.o", RTLD_GLOBAL)

# Define function pointers for interacting with the map
bpf_map_update_elem = bpf_obj.bpf_map_update_elem
bpf_map_update_elem.argtypes = [c_void_p, c_void_p, c_void_p]

# Set the port number to drop
port_to_drop = 4040
port_key = c_int(0)  # Key for the map
port_value = c_int(port_to_drop)

# Update the map with the desired port number (modify as needed)
bpf_map_update_elem(byref(port_key), byref(port_value), None)
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Save this script as userspace_config.py and run it:

Bash
python userspace_config.py
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Load the eBPF program (as root):

Bash
sudo ./drop_tcp
Use code with caution.
content_copy
This will attach the program to the ip_tcp_check kernel probe, where it can intercept and drop TCP packets on the configured port.

Unloading the Program:

Bash
sudo bpftool unload drop_tcp
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Explanation:

The drop_tcp.c program:

Defines a map using BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY to store the configurable port number.
Attaches to the ip_tcp_check kernel probe to inspect incoming TCP packets.
Retrieves the configured port number from the map.
Drops packets with a destination port matching the configured port.
Additional Notes:

This example demonstrates dropping packets on a specific port. You can modify the logic to filter based on other packet properties if needed.
eBPF programs can be complex and interact with the kernel directly. Exercise caution and test thoroughly in a non-production environment.
Refer to the bcc documentation (https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) for more advanced eBPF programming techniques.
